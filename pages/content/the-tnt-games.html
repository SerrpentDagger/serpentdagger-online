			<p>The TNT Games is a set of 50 two-player minigames and “attractions” that cover four basic categories, TNT related, Puzzle, Parkour, and General. Each game has an instruction booklet to let you know how to play. In most of the games, there is competition between you and the other player, but some of them are co-op.</p>

			<p>Over the course of the entire map, you will compete against each other to collect the most nether stars, one of which you gain for each minigame you win, along with a couple other methods which are explained in the map.</p>

			<p>There are 9 games in the TNT related section, 5 in Puzzle, 6 in Parkour, and 30 in General. The games in TNT related are generally about blowing each other up, with various twists and scenarios, the puzzles range from matching your code-breaking abilities against each other, the Parkour section contains themed courses of varying difficulties, and in General you'll find a vast array of different games.</p>
