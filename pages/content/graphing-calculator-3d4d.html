			<p>This is an advanced 3D/4D graphing calculator which allows for the rendering of complex functions in a wide variety of coordinate systems, with a wide variety of options.</p>

			<p>Graphs can be organized and arranged around each other in workspaces. They are built through the use of convenient operation blocks, which nest into one another to form an expression. You can declare variables and functions within a graph in the workspace, and reuse them in other ones of the same workspace. Further control is granted through conditional blocks, to allow for a highly flexible graphing system.</p>

			<p>The program is capable of graphing parametric, as well as four-dimensional functions. The 4D functions can be displayed flexibly so that the graph may be easily understood.</p>

			<p>The program interface can also be customized with a selection of different themes and backgrounds. You can modify or add to them yourself.</p>
			<p>Graphing Calculator SD now also supports ‘Multi-Value’ functionality - a powerful tool which allows for the graphing of non-functions and implicitly defined relations.</p>
