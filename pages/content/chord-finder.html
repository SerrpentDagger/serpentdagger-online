			<p>This is a simple text-based program that lets the user find guitar chord shapes based on capo-position.</p>
			<p>The program should be launched in the command terminal. On Windows, you can do that by double-clicking the attached bat file.</p>
			<p>The program flow first requests a selection of the chords which interest you. Then it allows you to display varieties of those chords based on shape, given a capo position of your choice. Finally it requests a priority for each chord, which can be its number of occurrences in the song you’re interested in. It will then rank the 12 frets based on your selection, and output a display of the ways you can play those chords in the highest-ranked key.</p>
			<p>No fancy installation necessary, just download the zip file and extract it.</p>

			<p>Disclaimer: The program is not highly refined. It’s just a useful little tool that I wanted to share.</p>
