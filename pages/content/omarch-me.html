			<p>Omarch-me is a fork of <a href="https://omarchy.org">Omarchy</a> by DHH: "a beautiful, modern & opinionated Linux distribution". This fork makes minor modifications to the install scripts that prioritise open-source apps and allow you to choose yourself which default apps to install with the OS.</p>
			<p>Omarch-me is exactly the same as Omarchy after the initial installation. During install, however, the user will be asked if they want all the default Omarchy apps, webbaps, and potentially the proprietary Nvidia drivers (if applicable).</p>
			<p>If the user chooses to customise their installation, only basic system apps will be automatically installed. The user then chooses extra apps to install (with their Omarchy configurations) from several small lists: 'Extra System', 'Media/Communications', 'Developer', and 'Unfree'.</p>
			<p>From there, you can enjoy your customised Omarchy setup without the artefacts of unwanted apps!</p>
			<h2>Installation and Customisation</h2>
			<p>Installation instructions are found on the <a href="https://github.com/SerrpentDagger/omarch-me">Omarch-me GitHub page</a>.</p>
